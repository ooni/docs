[edit file](https://github.com/ooni/data/edit/main/oonidata/docs/DataAnalysisDB.md)

In this document you will find information on how to perform analysis of OONI
data based on tables available in clickhouse.

It will include useful code snippets and descriptions about the semantics of
the various columns in the relevant database tables.

The main tables you should be looking at are the following:
* `fastpath`, which contains high level metadata about measurements as well as
  the fastpath analysis output which is primarily extracted from the probe.
  Each row in here maps to one measurement.
* `obs_web`, which contains much richer metadata that has been extracted from
  measurements. In here each row maps to one or more measurements.
* `obs_web_ctrl`, which contains metadata related to control measurements from
  the `web_connectivity` test.
* `analysis_web_measurement`, which contains the analysis outputs coming from
  OONI Pipeline v5.

For more details about the semantics of certain fields refer to the [ooni/spec documentation](https://github.com/ooni/spec/tree/master/data-formats).

## Fastpath
table: `fastpath`

This table contains high-level metadata about measurements and fastpath
analysis outputs. Each row maps to a single measurement.

- **measurement_uid** – Unique identifier for the measurement.
- **report_id** – Identifier of the the measurement set. The tuple (`report_id`, `input`) loosely maps to an individual measurement.
- **input** – The input tested (URL, domain, or other).
- **probe_cc** – Country code of the probe.
- **probe_asn** – Autonomous System Number (ASN) of the probe network.
- **test_name** – Name of the OONI test performed.
- **test_start_time** – Time the test session was initiated. Measurements sharing the same `report_id` will share the same `test_start_time`.
- **measurement_start_time** – Time the specific measurement began.
- **filename** – Name of the original uploaded report file.
- **scores** – Serialized scoring information (heuristics, flags).
- **platform** – Platform type (e.g., mobile, desktop).
- **anomaly** – Fastpath assessment of whether the measurement was anomalous (`t` or `f`).
- **confirmed** – Fastpath assessment of whether blocking/censorship was confirmed. This is done using our blocking fingerprints.
- **msm_failure** – Indicates if the measurement failed and should therefore be ignored.
- **domain** – Domain derived from the input.
- **software_name** – Name of the OONI probe software (eg. `ooniprobe-android`)
- **software_version** – Version of the OONI probe software.
- **test_version** – Version of the nettest.
- **architecture** – System architecture of the probe (e.g., arm64).
- **engine_name** – Name of the test engine.
- **engine_version** – Version of the test engine.
- **test_runtime** – Duration of the test run. Goes from `measurement_start_time` until the end of the individual measurement.
- **ooni_run_link_id** – If present, the ID of the OONI Run link used to trigger this measurement.

The following columns should be ignored
- **control_failure**
- **blocking_general**
- **is_ssl_expected**
- **page_len**
- **page_len_ratio**
- **server_cc**
- **server_asn**
- **server_as_name**
- **update_time**
- **blocking_type**
- **test_helper_address**
- **test_helper_type**


## Web Observations
table: `obs_web`

This table contains enriched metadata extracted from measurements. Each row
corresponds to one observation, which may map to multiple measurements.

All observations that are related to the same network transaction are mapped onto the same row. For example:
* DNS resolution for example.com -> [1.2.3.4, 2.3.4.5]
* TCP Connect to 1.2.3.4 on port 443
* TLS handshake for 1.2.3.4 on port 443
* HTTPS request

Will lead to the DNS, TCP, TLS and HTTPS observations for the IP target 1.2.3.4
ending up on the same row.

## Examples

It's useful to define a function for running SQL queries and returning a pandas
dataframe targeting the clickhouse database, as follows:
```
from clickhouse_driver import Client as Clickhouse

def click_query(q, params=None, settings=None):
    click = Clickhouse("localhost")
    return click.query_dataframe(q, params=params, settings=settings)
```

### Aggregating measurements by failure counts

Suppose you would like to plot observations by failure string so that you can
assess the reason why we are failing to connect to a specific target.

We make the assumption that if DNS fails, that will lead to TCP failing, if TCP
fails, that will lead to TLS failing and if TLS fails that will lead to HTTPS
failing.

This assumption holds true for most `web_connectivity` measurements (n.b. it's
not necessarily going to be the case for `web_connectivity` 0.5).

We can use the following query:

```
df_agg = click_query("""
WITH multiIf(
    dns_failure IS NOT NULL, tuple('dns', dns_failure),
    tcp_failure IS NOT NULL, tuple('tcp', tcp_failure),
    tls_failure IS NOT NULL, tuple('tls', tls_failure),
    http_failure IS NOT NULL, tuple('https', http_failure),
    tuple('ok', '')
) as failure,
failure.1 as failure_class,
IF(startsWith(failure.2, 'unknown_failure'), 'unknown_failure', failure.2) as failure_str_part,
failure.2 as failure_str_raw
SELECT 
probe_cc,
probe_asn,
probe_as_org_name,
toStartOfDay(measurement_start_time) as ts,
hostname,
resolver_asn,
IF(failure_class = 'ok', 'ok', concat(failure_class, '.', failure_str_part)) as failure_str,
COUNT() as cnt
FROM obs_web
WHERE measurement_start_time > %(measurement_start_day)s
AND measurement_start_time < %(measurement_end_day)s
AND probe_cc IN %(cc_list)s
AND hostname = %(hostname)s
GROUP BY probe_cc, probe_asn, probe_as_org_name, hostname, resolver_asn, ts, failure_str
""", params={
    "measurement_start_day": "2024-10-01",
    "measurement_end_day": "2024-11-11",
    "cc_list": ["IT"],
    "hostname": "archive.ph"
})
```

Note how in the `GROUP BY` section we are using as a grouping key `probe_asn`
and `resolver_asn`. This is helpful because the blocking signal may differ from
network to network, but in the case of DNS it will also be dependent on the DNS
resolver that the probe is configured to use (eg. probes on the same network
might produce different results if one is using the ISP provided resolver which
implements filtering vs a public resolver that does not).

We can then plot these results with:
```
alt.Chart(df_agg).mark_bar().encode(
    x='ts',
    y='cnt',
    color='failure_str',
    row='probe_asn',
    tooltip=['failure_str', 'cnt', 'ts', 'hostname']
).properties(
    width=500,
    height=100
)
```

![](img/plot-1.svg)

In the resulting plot it's worth noting two things:
1. The presence of several `host_unreachable` and `network_unreachable` failure
   strings. These are likely caused by the lack of IPv6 connectivity in the
probe.
2. Several failures appear as both `tls.$(failure)` and `https.$(failure)`.
   This is likely the result of double counting when the data pipeline is not
able to map a HTTPS transaction to the corresponding TLS handshake, hence they
end up on two separate rows.

Depending on your use-case you may want to exclude these instance by applying a
pandas filter such as:
```
alt.Chart(df_agg[
    (~df_agg['failure_str'].str.startswith('https'))
    & ~(
        (df_agg['failure_str'].str.contains('host_unreachable'))
        | (df_agg['failure_str'].str.contains('network_unreachable'))
    )
]).mark_bar().encode(
    x='ts',
    y='cnt',
    color='failure_str',
    row='probe_asn',
    tooltip=['failure_str', 'cnt', 'ts', 'hostname']
).properties(
    width=500,
    height=100
)
```

![](img/plot-2.svg)

Which results in a much cleaner signal.

Finally, we will now notice how the signal is still not so stable across the
`probe_asn`, which is likely caused by differences in the DNS configuration.

We can account for this by computing a new column which determines if the resolver is the ISP provided one or not:
```
df_agg['is_isp_resolver'] = df_agg['probe_asn'] == df_agg['resolver_asn']
```

and then placing them on two different columns:
```
alt.Chart(df_agg[
    (~df_agg['failure_str'].str.startswith('https'))
    & ~(
        (df_agg['failure_str'].str.contains('host_unreachable'))
        | (df_agg['failure_str'].str.contains('network_unreachable'))
    )
]).mark_bar().encode(
    x='ts',
    y='cnt',
    color='failure_str',
    row='probe_asn',
    column='is_isp_resolver',
    tooltip=['failure_str', 'cnt', 'ts', 'hostname']
).properties(
    width=500,
    height=100
)
```

![](img/plot-3.svg)

We can now see that this mostly clears up the signal.
