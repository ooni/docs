## Infrastructure Tiers

We divide our infrastructure components into 3 tiers:

- **Tier 0: Critical**: These are mission critical infrastructure components. If these become unavailable or have significant disruption, it will have a major impact.

- **Tier 1: Essential**: These components are important, but not as critical as
  tier 0. They are part of our core operations, but if they become unavailable
  the impact is important, but not major.

- **Tier 2: Non-Essential**: These are auxiliary components. Their
  unavailability does not have a major impact.
