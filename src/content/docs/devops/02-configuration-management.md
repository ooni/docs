It's recommended to make use of a virtualenv, for example managed using `pyenv virtualenv`:
```
pyenv virtualenv ooni-devops
pyenv activate ooni-devops
```

Install deps:
```
pip install ansible dnspython boto3
```

Run playbook:
```
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory
```

On macOS you might run into this issue: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/76322

The current workaround is to export the following environment variable before running ansible:
```
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
```
