**NOTE** The direction we are going with the new backend is that of dropping debian packaging of all backend API components and move to a dockerized deployment approach.

This section lists the Debian packages used to deploy backend
components. They are built by [GitHub CI workflows](#github-ci-workflows)&thinsp;ðŸ’¡
and deployed using [The deployer tool](#the-deployer-tool)&thinsp;ðŸ”§. See
[Debian package build and publish](#debian-package-build-and-publish)&thinsp;ðŸ’¡.
